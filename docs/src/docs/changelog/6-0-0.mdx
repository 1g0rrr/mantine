## createStyles breaking changes

[createStyles](https://mantine.dev/styles/create-styles/) function no longer receives `getRef`
as a third argument. Use `getStylesRef` exported from `@mantine/core` package instead:

```tsx
// in 5.x, will not work in 6.x
import { createStyles } from '@mantine/core';

createStyles((theme, params, getRef) => {
  child: { ref: getRef('child') },
  parent: { [`& .${getRef('child')}`]: { color: 'red' } },
});

// in 6.x use getStylesRef function
import { createStyles, getStylesRef } from '@mantine/core';

createStyles((theme, params) => {
  child: { ref: getStylesRef('child') },
  parent: { [`& .${getStylesRef('child')}`]: { color: 'red' } },
});
```

## @mantine/dates breaking changes

All components from `@mantine/dates` package were rebuilt from scratch.
Note that the following list is not full as it is difficult to include all breaking changes
after a full package revamp – follow documentation of component that you use to find out about
all breaking changes.

- Styles API selectors of components were changed
- `DatePicker` component was renamed to `DatePickerInput`
- `Calendar` component was renamed to `DatePicker`
- `TimeInput` component was migrated to native `input[type="time"]` as it provides better UX in most browsers
- `TimeRangeInput` component was removed – it is no longer exported from the package
- `DateRangePicker` and `RangeCalendar` components were removed – you can now setup dates range picking in [DatePicker](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/) and [DatePickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker-input/)
- `amountOfMonths` prop was renamed to `numberOfColumns` in all components
- `DatePickerInput` (previously `DatePicker`) component no longer supports `allowFreeInput` prop – use [DateInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-input/) component instead
- `DatePicker` (previously `Calendar`) component no longer supports `dayClassName` and `dayStyle` props – use `getDayProps` instead

## Theme object changes

You can no longer define `dateFormat` and `datesLocale` in [theme](https://mantine.dev/theming/theme-object/),
use components prop to specify format instead:

```tsx
// 5.x, will not work in 6.x
import { MantineProvider } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return (
    <MantineProvider theme={{ dateFormat: 'MMMM DD YYYY', datesLocale: 'es' }}>
      <App />
    </MantineProvider>
  );
}

// 6.x – use components props
import { DatePickerInput } from '@mantine/dates';

function Demo() {
  return <DatePickerInput valueFormat="MMMM D, YYYY" locale="es" />;
}
```

## Other breaking changes

- [Text](https://mantine.dev/core/text/) no longer supports `variant="link"`, use [Anchor](https://mantine.dev/core/anchor/) instead

## Updated @mantine/dates package

`@mantine/dates` package was rebuilt from scratch, it now includes new components to
pick [year](https://mantine.dev/dates/year-picker/), [month](https://mantine.dev/dates/month-picker/)
and [dates](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker/). All new pickers support `type` prop that can be:

- `default` – `Date | null` – user can pick one date
- `multiple` – `Date[]` – user can pick any number of dates
- `range` – `[Date | null, Date | null]` – user can pick a range of two dates

`type="default"` example with [DatePickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/date-picker-input/) component:

<Demo data={DatePickerInputDemos.usage} />

`type="multiple"` example with [MonthPickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/month-picker-input/) component:

<Demo data={MonthPickerInputDemos.multiple} />

`type="range"` example with [YearPickerInput](https://mantine.dev/dates/year-picker-input/) component:

<Demo data={YearPickerInputDemos.range} />
