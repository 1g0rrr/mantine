## Usage

Use `AreaChart` component without `type` prop to render a regular area chart.
In a regular area chart, each data series is plotted on its own and does
not interact with other series.

<Demo data={AreaChartDemos.usage} />

## Stacked area chart

Set `type="stacked"` to render a stacked area chart. In this type of area chart
stacking is applied along the vertical axis, allowing you to see the overall trend
as well as the contribution of each individual series to the total.

<Demo data={AreaChartDemos.stacked} />

## Percent area chart

Set `type="percent"` to render a percent area chart. In this type of area chart
the y-axis scale is always normalized to 100%, making it easier to compare the
contribution of each series in terms of percentages.

<Demo data={AreaChartDemos.percent} />

## Legend

To display chart legend, set `withLegend` prop:

<Demo data={AreaChartDemos.legend} />

## Legend position

You can pass props down to recharts [Legend](https://recharts.org/en-US/api/Legend)
component with `legendProps` prop. For example, setting `legendProps={{ verticalAlign: 'bottom', height: 50 }}`
will render the legend at the bottom of the chart and set its height to 50px.
