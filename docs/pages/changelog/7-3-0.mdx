## Form schema resolvers packages

`@mantine/form` schema validation resolver packages are now available as [separate packages](/form/schema-validation).
Moving resolvers to separate packages allows to make them type-safe and fully tested.
Old resolvers are still exported from `@mantine/form` package – you will be able to use them without any changes
until 8.0.0 release.

The new packages are drop-in replacements for old resolvers, they have the same API and can be used in the same way.

Example of zod resolver:

<InstallScript packages="zod mantine-form-zod-resolver" />

```tsx
import { z } from 'zod';
import { useForm } from '@mantine/form';
import { zodResolver } from 'mantine-form-zod-resolver';

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, { message: 'Name should have at least 2 letters' }),
  email: z.string().email({ message: 'Invalid email' }),
  age: z.number().min(18, { message: 'You must be at least 18 to create an account' }),
});

const form = useForm({
  initialValues: {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    age: 16,
  },
  validate: zodResolver(schema),
});

form.validate();
form.errors;
// -> {
//  name: 'Name should have at least 2 letters',
//  email: 'Invalid email',
//  age: 'You must be at least 18 to create an account'
// }
```

## Documentation updates

- Schema based validation with `@mantine/form` now has [dedicated page](/form/schema-validation). It includes more examples for basic, nested and list fields validation for each resolver.

## Other changes

- [use-hash](/hooks/use-hash/) hook now supports `getInitialValueInEffect: false` option to get initial value during state initialization.
- New `useMantineColorScheme({ keepTransitions: true })` option allows keeping transitions when color scheme changes. Note that it is `false` by default.
- All templates were migrated to [yarn v4](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/release/4.0) – this change significantly improves installation speed.
