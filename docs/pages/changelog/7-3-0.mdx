## Form schema resolvers packages

`@mantine/form` schema validation resolver packages are now available as [separate packages](/form/schema-validation).
Moving resolvers to separate packages allows to make them type-safe and fully tested.
Old resolvers are still exported from `@mantine/form` package – you will be able to use them without any changes
until 8.0.0 release.

The new packages are drop-in replacements for old resolvers, they have the same API and can be used in the same way.

Example of zod resolver:

<InstallScript packages="zod mantine-form-zod-resolver" />

```tsx
import { z } from 'zod';
import { useForm } from '@mantine/form';
import { zodResolver } from 'mantine-form-zod-resolver';

const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(2, { message: 'Name should have at least 2 letters' }),
  email: z.string().email({ message: 'Invalid email' }),
  age: z.number().min(18, { message: 'You must be at least 18 to create an account' }),
});

const form = useForm({
  initialValues: {
    name: '',
    email: '',
    age: 16,
  },
  validate: zodResolver(schema),
});

form.validate();
form.errors;
// -> {
//  name: 'Name should have at least 2 letters',
//  email: 'Invalid email',
//  age: 'You must be at least 18 to create an account'
// }
```

## rem/em functions improvements

[rem and em](/styles/rem) function now support space separated values. This feature is available
both in `rem` function exported from `@mantine/core` package and [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset).
Note that you need to update `postcss-preset-mantine` to `1.10.0` to use this feature.

```tsx
import { rem } from '@mantine/core';

rem('16px 32px');
// -> calc(1rem * var(--mantine-scale)) calc(2rem * var(--mantine-scale))
```

All components props that are converted to `rem` units now support space separated values as well.
For example, space separated values can be used in `radius` prop of [Modal](/core/modal) component:

```tsx
import { Modal } from '@mantine/core';

function Demo() {
  return <Modal radius="10px 10px 0 0" opened onClose={() => {}} />;
}
```

## Outline Checkbox and Radio variant

<Demo data={Changelog730Demos.checkboxRadioVariant} />

## HueSlider and AlphaSlider components

[HueSlider and AlphaSlider](/core/color-picker) components were added back:

<Demo data={ColorPickerDemos.hueSlider} />

<br />

<Demo data={ColorPickerDemos.alphaSlider} />

## Documentation updates

- Schema based validation with `@mantine/form` now has [dedicated page](/form/schema-validation). It includes more examples for basic, nested and list fields validation for each resolver.
- [Autocomplete](/core/autocomplete), [Select](/core/select), [MultiSelect](/core/multi-select) and [TagsInput](/core/tags-input) now include new demos that show how to customize dropdown behavior and styles.

## Other changes

- [use-hash](/hooks/use-hash/) hook now supports `getInitialValueInEffect: false` option to get initial value during state initialization.
- New `useMantineColorScheme({ keepTransitions: true })` option allows keeping transitions when color scheme changes. Note that it is `false` by default.
- All templates were migrated to [yarn v4](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/release/4.0) – this change significantly improves installation speed.
- [TypographyStylesProvider](/core/typography-styles-provider) now has styles for `<kbd />` element.
- [MultiSelect](/core/multi-select) and [TagsInput](/core/tags-input) components now support `hiddenValuesDivider` prop. It allows customizing divider character between values in `value` prop of the hidden input.
- [Grid](/core/grid) component now supports `overflow` props, which allows controlling `overflow` CSS property on the root element. It is `hidden` by default.
