## Usage with Sass

It is now possible to use Mantine with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). You can find documentation
on [this page](/styles/sass/). Note that it is still required to set up [postcss-preset-mantine](/styles/postcss-preset/)
in order for all functions to work properly. Sass can be used as a replacement for [CSS modules](/styles/css-modules/)
â€“ it supports all features that CSS modules support.

You can find example of Mantine + Sass usage in separate branches of templates:

- [Next.js app router + Sass example](https://github.com/mantinedev/next-app-template/tree/sass)
- [Vite + Sass example](https://github.com/mantinedev/vite-template/tree/sass)
